# GDP vs Life Expectancy and Population, after Gapminder.

A bokeh rendering of Gapminder's data on GDP and life expectancy over the years.

You can see the graph [online](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/louridas/gdp_life_expectancy_gapminder/blob/master/gdp_life_expectancy_gapminder.ipynb); just scroll down if you do not want to know how it's done.

Many thanks to Gapminder that provide all the data and show what is possible to do with that.
